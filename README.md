I don't think my design is the best, but when I use a travel app I like it if there is a map of where I want to go so I can see it beforehand.
So, half of the app is a map where you can click on cities and the other half displays the information.

I have also never used any of foursquares applications before so I didn't know what information is important for the users of foursqaure.
